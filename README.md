<h1 align='center'>About Me</h1>
As a physics graduate, I have a strong inclination toward problem-solving which led me to pursue a career as a data scientist, who is passionate about creating AI tools for businesses. Recently, I completed a course on AI programming with Python from Udacity, during which I developed a command-line application that classifies flower species using images. This project helped me improve my programming skills in Python and familiarized me with libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and gained a deeper understanding of neural networks.

<br>
To enhance my skills and take my career to the next level, I am currently immersing myself in the field of data science. I am taking the Google Data Analytics Coursera program, which has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts of data analysis and visualization tools such as SQL, Python, and Google Analytics. I am eager to apply this knowledge to real-world problems and continue to develop my programming skills in data science.
